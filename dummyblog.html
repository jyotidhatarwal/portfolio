            Dummy text: Its function as a filler or as a tool for comparing the
        visual impression of different typefaces Dummy text is text that is used
        in the publishing industry or by web designers to occupy the space which
        will later be filled with 'real' content. This is required when, for
        example, the final text is not yet available. Dummy text is also known
        as 'fill text'. It is said that song composers of the past used dummy
        texts as lyrics when writing melodies in order to have a 'ready-made'
        text to sing with the melody. Dummy texts have been in use by
        typesetters since the 16th century.
